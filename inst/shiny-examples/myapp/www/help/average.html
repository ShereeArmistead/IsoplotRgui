Let t = {t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>} be a set of <sub>n</sub>
age estimates determined on different aliquots of the same sample, and
let s[t<sub>1</sub>], ..., s[t<sub>n</sub>]} be their analytical
uncertainties. <tt>IsoplotR</tt> then calculates the weighted mean of
these data assuming a Normal distribution with two sources of
variance:

<p></p>
t<sub>i</sub> ~ <i>N</i>( &mu;, &sigma;<sup>2</sup> =
s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup> + &omega;<sup>2</sup> )
<span class="alignright">(eq. 1)</span>
<p></p>

where &mu; is the mean, &sigma;<sup>2</sup> is the total variance and
&omega; is the 'overdispersion'. Equation 1 can be solved for &mu; and
&omega; by the method of maximum likelihood.
<tt>IsoplotR</tt> uses a modified version of Chauvenet's criterion for
outlier detection:

<ol>
<li> Compute the error-weighted mean of the n age determinations
  t<sub>i</sub> using their analytical uncertainties s[t<sub>i</sub>]
  by solving Equation 1 for &mu; and &omega; as discussed
  before.
</li>
<li> For each t<sub>i</sub>, compute the probability p<sub>i</sub>
  that that |t-&mu;|>|t<sub>i</sub>-&mu;| for
<p>
  t ~ <i>N</i>(0,&radic;<span style="text-decoration: overline;">
    s[t<sub>i</sub>]<sup>2</sup>+&omega;<sup>2</sup>
  </span>)
<span class="alignright">(eq. 2)</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
  Let p<sub>j</sub> &equiv; min(p<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,p<sub>n</sub>).
  If p<sub>j</sub><0.05/n, then reject the j<sup>th</sup> date, reduce
  n by one (i.e., n &rarr; (n-1) and repeat steps 1 through 3 until
  the surviving dates pass the third step.
</li>
</ol>

If the analtyical uncertainties are small compared to the scatter
between the dates (i.e. if &omega; >> s[t<sub<i</sub>] for all
i), then this generalised algorithm reduces to the conventional
Chauvenet criterion. If the analytical uncertainties are large and the
data do not exhibit any overdispersion, then the heuristic outlier
detection method is equivalent to Ludwig (2003)'s '2-sigma' method.
