The Th-U evolution diagram is a scatter plot that sets out the
<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U-activity ratios against
the <sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>238</sup>U-activity ratios as error ellipses
(drawn at 100[1-&alpha;]% confidence level), and displays the initial
<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U-activity ratios and ages as a set of
intersecting lines. The Th-U evolution diagram has a similar and
purpose and appearance as the U-Pb concordia diagram, which also
displays compositions and dates simultaneously. An alternative way of
doing so is to plot the
<sup>234</sup>U/<sup>238</sup>U-ratios against the
<sup>230</sup>Th/<sup>234</sup>U-<sup>238</sup>U-ages. In
both types of evolution diagrams, <tt>IsoplotR</tt> provides the
option to project the raw measurements along the best fitting isochron
line and thereby remove the detrital
<sup>230</sup>Th-component. This procedure allows a visual
assessment of the degree of homogeneity within a dataset, as is
quantified by the MSWD.

The Th-U evolution diagram has a similar and purpose and appearance as
the U-Pb concordia diagram, which also displays compositions and dates
simultaneously. For igneous datasets, in which <sup>234</sup>U and
<sup>238</sup>U are in secular equilibrium,
<tt>IsoplotR</tt> produces an (Osmond-style) isochron plot that is
decorated with a fanning set of isochrone lines.
