{"intro":{"en":"IsoplotR is an R package for geochronology that was designed to be free, flexible and future-proof. The package was named after but is not based on Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to Microsoft Excel.

CADs have two desirable properties. First, they do not require any pre-treatment or smoothing of the data. This is not the case for histograms or kernel density estimates.  Second, it is easy to superimpose several CADs on the same plot.  This facilitates the intercomparison of multiple samples. The interpretation of CADs is straightforward but not very intuitive. The prominence of individual age components is proportional to the steepness of the CAD. This is different from probability density estimates such as histograms, in which such components stand out as peaks. It is arguably easier to identify peaks than inflection points and this probably why CADs are not as widely used as probability density estimates. But the ease of interpretation of density estimates comes at a cost, as they require smoothing and cannot as easily be combined as CADs.","cn":""},"concordia_intro":{"en":"The concordia diagram is a graphical means of assessing the internal consistency of U-Pb data.

Given several aliquots from a single sample, they allow the non-radiogenic component of the daughter nuclide to be quantified and separated from the radiogenic component.

If h[t] depends on t, then KDE(t) is known as an 'adaptive' KDE.  The default bandwidth used by <tt>IsoplotR<\/tt> is calculated using the algorithm of Botev et al. (2010) and modulated by the adaptive smoothing approach of Abramson (1982). The rationale behind adaptive kernel density estimation is to use a narrower bandwidth near the peaks of the sampling distribution (where the ordered dates are closely spaced in time), and a wider bandwidth in the distribution's sparsely sampled troughs. Thus, the resolution of the density estimate is optimised according to data availability. Kernel density estimates are not to be confused with <tt>Isoplot<\/tt>'s 'probability density plots' (PDPs). The mathematical definition of a PDP closely resembles that of the KDE, the only difference being the substitution of the bandwidth h[t] by the analytical uncertainty s[t<sub>i<\/sub>] in Equation 1. This similarity in appearance and definition is the source of much confusion.

Thus, an MDS-configuration serves as a 'map' in which similar samples cluster closely together and dissimilar samples plot far apart. In the context of detrital geochronology, the dissimilarity between samples is given by the statistical distance between age distributions. There are many ways to define this statistical distance. <tt>IsoplotR<\/tt> uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic for this purpose due to its simplicity and the fact that it behaves like a true distance in the mathematical sense of the word (Vermeesch, 2013, 2018). The KS-distance is closely related to the CAD-plot.  It is given by the maximum vertical distance between two CAD step functions. Thus, the KS-distance takes on values between zero (perfect match between two age distributions) and one (no overlap between two distributions).  Calculating the KS-distance between samples two at a time populates a symmetric dissimilarity matrix with positive values and a zero diagonal. <tt>IsoplotR<\/tt> implements two algorithms to convert this matrix into a configuration. The first ('classical' MDS) approach uses a sequence of basic matrix manipulations to achieve a linear fit between the KS-distances and the fittted distances on the MDS configuration. The second, more sophisticated ('nonmetric' MDS) approach subjects the input distances to a transformation f prior to fitting a configuration:\n\n<p><\/p>\n&delta;<sub>i,j<\/sub> = f(KS<sub>i,j<\/sub>)\n<p><\/p>\n\nwhere KS<sub>i,j<\/sub> is the KS-distance between samples i and j (for 1 &le; i &ne; j &le; n) and &delta;<sub>i,j<\/sub> is the 'disparity'. Fitting an MDS configuration then involves finding the disparity transformation that maximises the goodness of fit (or minimises the 'stress') between the disparities and the fitted distances. The latter two quantities can also be plotted against each other as a 'Shepard plot'.

In the most common implementation of this approach, the induced fission tracks are recorded by an external detector made of mica or plastic that is attached to the polished grain surface (Fleischer and Hart, 1972; Hurford and Green, 1983). The\nfission track age equation then becomes:\n\n<p><\/p>\nt = ln[\n1 + {&lambda;<sub>238<\/sub>&zeta;&rho;<sub>d<\/sub>N<sub>s<\/sub>}\/\n{2 N<sub>i<\/sub>}] \/\n&lambda;<sub>238<\/sub>\n<span class=\"alignright\">(eq. 2)<\/span>\n<p><\/p>\n\nwhere N<sub>i<\/sub> is the number of induced fission tracks counted in the external detector over the same area as the spontaneous tracks, &zeta; is a 'zeta'-calibration factor that incorporates both the fission decay constant and the etchable fission track length, and &rho;<sub>d<\/sub> is the number of induced fission tracks per unit area counted in a co-irradiated glass of known U-concentration. &rho;<sub>d<\/sub> allows the &zeta;-factor to be 'recycled' between irradiations.\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"hide4EDM hide4absolute show4ICP\">\nThe <sup>238<\/sup>U-concentration can also be measured directly by LAICPMS. Unfortunately the accuracy of LAICPMS-based age estimates is compromised by the absence of matrix-matched concentrations standards, and uncertainies associated with the fission track decay constant and the etching and counting efficiencies.  These systematic errors can be removed by normalising to a standard of known fission track age and defining a new 'zeta' calibration constant &zeta;<sub>icp<\/sub>:\n\n<p><\/p>\nt =\nln( 1 + {2 &zeta;<sub>icp<\/sub> &lambda;<sub>238<\/sub>N<sub>2<\/sub>}\/\n{[<sub>238<\/sub>U] A<sub>s<\/sub>})\/\n&lambda;<sub>238<\/sub>\n<span class=\"alignright\">(eq. 2)<\/span>\n<p><\/p>\n\nwhere [<sup>238<\/sup>U] may either stand for the <sup>238<\/sup>U-concentration (in ppm) <i>or<\/i> for the U\/Ca (for apatite) or U\/Si (for zircon) ratio measurement, and A<sub>s<\/sub> is the spontaneous track counting area, which may either correspond to one laser spot or to a larger area (if multiple U-measurements were made).\n<\/div>","cn":""},"SmNd_redundancy":{"en":"<p><\/p>\n<tt>IsoplotR<\/tt> uses these data to calculate the <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios and the correlation between the <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd- and the <sup>143<\/sup>Nd\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-uncertainties.","cn":""},"SmNd_Sm147Nd144":{"en":"Measured <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios.","cn":""},"SmNd_err_Sm147Nd144":{"en":"Analytical uncertainty of the <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios","cn":""},"SmNd_Nd143Nd144":{"en":"Measured <sup>143<\/sup>Nd\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios.","cn":""},"SmNd_err_Nd143Nd144":{"en":"Analytical uncertainty of the <sup>143<\/sup>Nd\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios","cn":""},"SmNd_rho_Sm147Nd144Nd143Nd144":{"en":"Error correlations between the <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd and <sup>143<\/sup>Nd\/<sup>144<\/sup>Nd-ratios (optional).","cn":""},"SmNd_Sm":{"en":"Sm concentration, in ppm.","cn":""},"SmNd_err_Sm":{"en":"Analytical uncertainty of the Sm concentration, in ppm ","cn":""},"SmNd_Nd":{"en":"Nd concentration, in ppm.","cn":""},"SmNd_err_Nd":{"en":"Analytical uncertainty of the Nd concentration, in ppm ","cn":""},"SmNd_Sm147Nd143":{"en":"Measured <sup>147<\/sup>Sm\/<sup>143<\/sup>Nd-ratios.","cn":""},"spectrum_intro":{"en":"The <sup>40<\/sup>Ar\/<sup>39<\/sup>Ar-age spectrum is a useful tool to visualise stepwise heating measurements.
