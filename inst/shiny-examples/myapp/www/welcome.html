<a href="http://isoplotr.london-geochron.com">IsoplotR</a> is
an <tt>R</tt> implementation of Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to
Microsoft Excel that was designed to be free, flexible and
future-proof. The program implements functions for U-Pb,
Pb-Pb, <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Re-Os,
U-Th-He, fission track and U-series disequilibrium dating as well as
detrital geochronology.

This website provides easy to use point-and-click access
to <tt>IsoplotR</tt>'s most commonly used functions (see
the <a href="#"
onclick="$('#myplot').load('tutorial.html');">tutorial</a> for
details).  Alternatively, the same functions (and more) can also be
accessed from the command-line through the <tt>IsoplotR</tt> package
on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=IsoplotR">CRAN</a>.

An extensive description of the mathematical-statistical basis of this
software is being prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.
A reference to this publication will be added to this page when ready.
In the meanwhile, any feedback can be sent
